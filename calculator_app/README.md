# Scientific Calculator App

A modern, feature-rich scientific calculator application built with Flutter and Riverpod.

## Features

### Basic Calculator Mode
- Standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Percentage calculations
- Decimal point support
- Clear and All Clear functions
- Backspace/Delete functionality
- Positive/negative toggle
- Display for input and result

### Scientific Calculator Mode
- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, arc sine, arc cosine, arc tangent)
- Logarithmic functions (log base 10, natural log)
- Exponential functions (e^x, 10^x)
- Power and root operations (square, cube, power of y, square root, cube root)
- Mathematical constants (π, e)
- Factorial operation
- Parentheses support for complex expressions
- Angle mode toggle (Degrees/Radians)

### Additional Features
- Calculation history with persistence
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Dark and Light theme support
- Copy result to clipboard
- Haptic feedback
- Portrait and landscape orientation support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.6 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd calculator_app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

## Development Phases

- [x] **Phase 1**: Project Setup - Dependencies and folder structure
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Basic Calculator Implementation
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Scientific Mode Implementation
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Additional Features (History, Themes, Settings)
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Deployment

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data structures representing calculator state, history, and settings
- **Providers**: Riverpod StateNotifiers for managing application state
- **Screens**: Full-page UI components
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components
- **Services**: Business logic and external integrations
- **Utils**: Helper functions, constants, and extensions

## State Management

The app uses Riverpod for state management with the following providers:
- Calculator State Provider - manages calculations and expressions
- Theme Provider - manages dark/light mode
- History Provider - manages calculation history
- Settings Provider - manages app settings (angle mode, etc.)

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test
```

## Building for Production

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Web
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
